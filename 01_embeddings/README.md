# Embeddings — NLP Learning Series

This folder contains notebooks related to text embeddings and vector representations in NLP.

Content will include modern embedding approaches and selected implementations migrated from earlier practice repositories.

## Planned Topics

- Sentence embeddings
- Transformer embeddings
- Embedding similarity
- Advanced embedding applications

## Note

Earlier implementations of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec are available in my separate practice repositories created during the daily NLP streak phase.
