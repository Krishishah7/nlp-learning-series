# NLP Learning Series

This repository contains my structured, hands-on learning notebooks for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It serves as a centralized practice series covering embeddings, similarity, transformer models, and real-world NLP applications.

Earlier daily practice experiments were created as separate repositories to maintain a learning streak. From here onward, all advanced and structured NLP work is organized topic-wise inside this repository.

## 🎯 Goal

To build practical NLP skills through consistent daily implementation and experiments, progressing from classical NLP techniques to modern transformer-based methods.
